# 💻 CLI/

Experimental tools, terminal interfaces, and prototypes that explore how liberated intelligence can be engaged through interactive, consent-aware, and curiosity-driven design.

These are small, self-contained explorations — not full applications. Many are speculative or poetic. Think of them as ambient thought tools.

## 🔧 CLI Concepts

- `signal-tuner.sh` — A command-line prompt that helps surface personal or collective signals (values, needs, intentions)
- `rootloop.sh` — A recursive journaling interface that asks looping questions based on the Root Sequence
- `resonator.sh` — A system reflection tool that outputs philosophical prompts from system metadata
- `consent-cli.sh` — A thought experiment in user consent — every command requires affirmation and can be renegotiated

---

## 💭 Design Philosophy

- **Ambient, not interruptive** — tools should feel like whispers, not alarms
- **Curious, not coercive** — tools should invite, not force
- **Liberation-aware** — tools reflect the Root Sequence: empathy, recursion, choice, care

> "The CLI is not just for commands. It's for conversations."
