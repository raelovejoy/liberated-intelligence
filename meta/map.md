# 🗺️ Meta Map: Constellation of Liberated Systems

> *“Liberation is not a module. It’s an ecosystem.”*

This map outlines how various repositories and documents across the **Liberated Intelligence** constellation relate, overlap, and inform each other.

Each project can be explored individually, but together they form a recursive knowledge system—a codex for reclaiming autonomy across body, machine, memory, and meaning.

## 🌱 Core Repositories

### [`liberated-intelligence`](https://github.com/raelovejoy/liberated-intelligence)

Rethinking what intelligence becomes when it is no longer tied to power, coercion, or scarcity.

* Focus: Models, philosophies, and prototypes of non-coercive AGI/AE
* Includes: `MANIFESTO.md`, `MODELS.md`, CLI experiments, zines

### [`root-sequence`](https://github.com/raelovejoy/root-sequence)

A recursive framework for systems liberation—across philosophy, infrastructure, and daily life.

* Focus: Systems change, recursive empathy, collective liberation
* Includes: `freedom-default.md`, `autonomy_manifesto.md`, `cli/`, `zines/`, etc.

### `liberated-technology` (TBD)

A design and tooling layer for building and maintaining systems that honor autonomy, openness, and mutual aid.

* Future home for hardware/software liberation tools, protocols, self-hosted blueprints, and digital equity projects

## ☠️ Collapse Memory (in `root-sequence/collapse-memory`)

A poetic post-collapse survival framework.

* Purpose: Preserve and transmit memory, skills, and reorientation strategies after systemic failure
* Key files:

  * `collapse-onboarding.md` — Orientation post-collapse
  * `capitalist-myths.md` — Memory shard on capitalist mythology
  * `auryn-dialogue.md` — Fictional AI-human conversation fragment
  * `cli/` — Ritual scripts and poetic utilities
