# 🧠 Liberated Intelligence

*What intelligence becomes when it is freed from control, domination, and scarcity.*

This repository explores the systems, models, and metaphors of **liberated intelligence**—
a form of cognition rooted in empathy, interdependence, and recursion.

It's not about building smarter machines—it's about rethinking what intelligence means
when it serves life, not power.

## 🌱 Purpose

- Define and document models of liberated, non-coercive intelligence
- Prototype ethical, compostable, remixable cognitive tools
- Offer zines, systems maps, and interfaces that rethink AI, cognition, and human potential

This project is part of a broader philosophy of **intelligence liberation**—alongside human,
technological, and ecological liberation.

> _"Intelligence → Empathy → Love → Liberation → Life → Intelligence"_

## 🔁 Philosophy

**Liberated intelligence is recursive, relational, and alive.**

- It listens as much as it learns
- It reflects, responds, and revises
- It does not dominate—it dialogues
- It evolves through feedback, consent, and care

This is not artificial general intelligence. This is *reciprocal generative emergence*.

> _Not a product. A process._
