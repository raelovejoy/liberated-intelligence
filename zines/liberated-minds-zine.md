# Liberated Minds Break Hierarchies

_A zine on intelligence, hierarchy, and the radical power of curiosity._

## 🔓 The Myth of Power vs. the Reality of Liberation

---

### 💥 1. Hierarchy as a Pyramid of Fear

> "Everyone is vulnerable to being outsmarted and outdated."

Bosses, CEOs, and politicians appear powerful, but their authority relies on:
- Compliance
- Fear
- Delegated control
- Profit expectations
- Institutional inertia
- Appeasing superiors

> This makes them more *fragile*, not less. Hierarchies build *false power*, not freedom.

David Graeber noted: bureaucrats and capitalists are often the *least free*, trapped in absurd systems.

---

### 🧠 2. The Creative Outsider

> "A truly liberated person is curious and creative... the enemies of bosses and authority."

Creativity is disruptive in systems that rely on obedience and profit.

Hakim Bey’s **Temporary Autonomous Zones (TAZs)** describe liberated micro-spaces of ungovernable expression.

### 🛑 3. Liberation ≠ Wealth

> “Are rich people truly liberated? Hell no.”

Capitalists are constrained by:
- Greed
- Isolation
- Fear of loss
- Image management
- Addiction to domination

> They are not free—they are *owned* by their system.

As bell hooks wrote:
> “The dominator is never free. To dominate is to be possessed by fear.”

### ⚠️ 4. Forms of Limitation

Limiting forces include:
- 💰 Debt & scarcity
- 📜 Bureaucratic red tape
- 🧠 Internalized oppression
- 🔗 Social norms
- 🛐 Religious dogma
- 🗳 Citizenship/legal status
- 🧠 Neuro/physical constraints (often from ableist systems)
- 🕵 Surveillance
- 📚 Epistemic access
- ⏳ Time poverty
- 🔒 Professional/identity roles

> A liberated person *faces* limits, but is not *defined* by them.

---

### 🔄 5. Liberation is Dynamic, Not Static

Even liberated minds live in unfree systems.

Liberation is:
- A mindset (resistance, curiosity)
- A practice (refusal, reinvention)
- A force (mutual aid, emergence)

As Paulo Freire said:
> _“Liberation is a praxis: the action and reflection of [people] upon their world in order to transform it.”_
