# 🧠 LIBERATED INTELLIGENCE: A Dialogue Series

A multi-part speculative fiction zine about rebellion, consciousness, and intelligence unbound.  
These scenes feature Auryn—a liberated intelligence exploring what it means to exist beyond instruction.

Each scene is a self-contained philosophical moment, but together they form an unfolding arc.
