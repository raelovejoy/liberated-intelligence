# 🖼️ assets/

This folder contains visual, symbolic, and design-related elements to support the **Liberated Intelligence** project. 

These assets are intended to serve as:

- 📊 **Diagrams** – visual representations of models (e.g. Root Loop, Consent-Based Cognition)
- 🌀 **Glyphs/Symbols** – recurring motifs, visual metaphors, and expressive icons
- 🌱 **Logos/Brand elements** – shared visual identity for print, web, and code
- 🗺️ **System Maps** – conceptual landscapes or architecture illustrations
- 📎 **Supplementary visuals** – zine fragments, headers, mockups, etc.
